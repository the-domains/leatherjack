Of course, I'll want you to part with your hard earned cash too, but only in exchange for high quality over-engineered designs that you won't find any where else. That doesn't mean there are no companies out there making high quality full-grain leather goods,there are a few, we love them and I buy all their stuff. I don't compete with them, I create designs that other companies don't, or won't, or haven't thought of yet.
