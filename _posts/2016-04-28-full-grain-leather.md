**Less than 2% of leather products in the market are truly full-grain, fully tanned, and fully durable. Various "tricks of the trade" are in full force, designed to fool you into parting with your hard earned cash in exchange for wretched "leather". When you hear terms like top grain, _genuine leather_, and _bonded leather_, it sounds attractive and price tags usually follow suit,but caveat emptor (buyer beware), the only thing genuine about it is the scam.**

Of course, I'll want you to part with your hard earned cash too, but only in exchange for high quality over-engineered designs that you won't find any where else. That doesn't mean there are no companies out there making high quality full-grain leather goods,there are a few, we love them and I buy all their stuff. I don't compete with them, I create designs that other companies don't, or won't, or haven't thought of yet.
